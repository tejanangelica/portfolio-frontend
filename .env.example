# Frontend Environment Variables Example
# Copy this file to .env.local for local development

# Backend API Configuration
# For local development, use localhost
# For production, this will be automatically detected by the frontend JavaScript
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Custom domain for production (if different from auto-detection)
# NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com

# Note: The frontend automatically detects the environment and uses:
# - http://localhost:3000 for local development
# - Your Render backend URL for production
# This is handled in assets/js/script.js
